# WebPresence: Track Your Presence on the Internet

WebPresence is a privacy-focused tool that helps users find and track information about themselves across the Internet. It aims to provide an easy way for individuals to monitor and stay informed about their online footprint. 

## Motivation

In today's digital age, a significant amount of personal information is available online, oftentime without a user's knowledge or consent. This can include breached passwords (from data breaches), personal details, or any other sensitive personal data. WebPresence was created to educate and empower users to take control of their online privay, by providing a centralized platform to discover and track the information that is available about them on the Internet. 

## Features

- Information aggregation: WebPresence scans the web, and gathers personal information about the user, to present in an easy-to-understand format
- Alerts: users can configure WebPresence to email them on a regular interval, about any new data that is found about them

## Usage 

- Navigate to the web link for WebPresence: https://main.d2ztiv3whbgh7p.amplifyapp.com/
- Select "Trigger Scan" to trigger a new scan of your information
- Select "Get Scanned Data" to get the history of scans done
- Navigate to "Profile" then select "Subscribe" to subscribe to emails about your online footprint
- Click "Remove data" to receive tips on managing your online presence

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
